                    Suyash Keshari is a 26 years old wildlife presenter and filmmaker. Wildlife has fascinated his entire life. 
                    It began at a very tender age of four, under the influence and tutelage of my late grandfather. 
                    What began as a disgust for animals kept in captivity slowly transformed into love and thirst for learning about 
                    the last remaining wild places on our planet.
